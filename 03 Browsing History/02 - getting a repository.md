# Getting a Repository in Git

"Getting a repository" usually means one of two things: either you're starting a **new project** from scratch on your computer, or you're **downloading an existing project** from a platform like GitHub.

## Method 1: Start a New Project (`git init`)

Use this when you have a folder on your computer that isn't using Git yet, and you want to start tracking changes.

1. **Navigate** to your project folder in the terminal:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project

## Method 2: Cloning an Existing Repository

Cloning is the most common way to get a copy of a project that is already hosted on a remote server like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

## Overview
When you clone a repository, Git doesn't just download the latest version of the files; it downloads the **entire history** of the project, including every commit and every branch.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Obtain the Repository URL
Navigate to the repository page on your hosting service (e.g., GitHub) and click the **Code** button. Copy the HTTPS or SSH URL.
* *Example:* `https://github.com/user/repository.git`

### 2. Run the Clone Command
Open your terminal and type `git clone` followed by the URL you copied:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/username/repository-name.git](https://github.com/username/repository-name.git)
